# SomeCMakeMagic
A minimal collection of CMake macros that make my C\* dev life easier. Currently, you can use this "library" to do the following:
* Find all child directories of a certain directory
* Determine the current directory's name
* Find all the C\*-related files in a directory
* Link all directories in a directory against a target
* Build all targets in a directory
* Copy resources for easy building/execution

## Examples / Use cases
Not much here yet beyond the simple "hello world" project, but hopefully there will be more to follow on this in the future, especially as I get back to using this code and adding to it. Help here is highly appreciated!

## Other
If you like this (mini) project, please feel free to contribute in the form of code or bug reports.
