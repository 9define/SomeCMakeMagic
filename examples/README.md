# Small code examples
Each of the subdirectories of this folder contains a small code example that uses the [main macros file](../SomeCMakeMagic.cmake).

# Trying examples
* To test all of the examples given, run `./scripts/test-all`.
* To run only one example, run `./scripts/test-single-example [example name]`.
Testing will run the example and check for expected output or similar.

# Building
* To build all examples without running them, do `./scripts/build-all`.
* To build only one example without running it, do `./scripts/build-single-example [example name]`.

# Cleaning
* To clean all examples, do `./scripts/clean-all`.
* To clean only one example, do `./scripts/clean-example [example name]`.
